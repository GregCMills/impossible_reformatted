\chapter{Exeunt: The Bookshop}
\begin{multicols}{2}
Many entrances to the Night World come and go, washing in and out with the tide of Carcosa. When they fade, they're not gone. A placeholder remains. The Bookshop is such a place. It's not a shop. Not really. It's an orifice that spews madness from the Night World to Earth.The Bookshop exists in many times and many places. Conterminous, infinite Earths surround it, or perhaps these worlds are only illusions generated around it. From time to time it intersects with the New York City that the Agents know, silently filling a gap that few can see.Its appearance and disappearance are so seamless, so in-tune with the world, that none have noticed the oddities that surround it. Its small, cluttered window, covered by a rusted steel security gate, seems to slide past the eyes. It never goes deep enough into the mind to leave anything behind in memory. No sign advertises the shop's presence. Once the word BOOKS was painted on the inside of the window, but only golden paint scraps now trace a dim outline of the word. The door is broken and is always open.Occasionally, the proprietor stands out front. A tall, meticulously dressed man of North African descent, with a waistcoat barely containing a cartoonish paunch, he smokes Turkish cigarettes and has a smile like a puzzle-box. He never frequents the nearby shops. He has everything he could ever need, inside.It was in the Bookshop that Asa Daribondi left his copy of  in June 1921, Libro Secretorum Manifestahoping to release himself from his dark obsessions. In February 1995, Abigail Wright discovered her copy of here, and in it a way to the Night The King in Yellow World. Daribondi and Wright even saw each other in the Bookshop. Such things are possible in the Night World, where time simply is…not.Everyone who has ever been in the Bookshop remains there, forever, if you know how to look.That's just the way the proprietor likes it.// Impossible Landscapes //
\section{Inside the Bookshop}
The Bookshop meanders and winds. Rows and rows of leaning shelves filled with books track in corridors like trails cut into bamboo, lit by naked bulbs. Steps go up and steps go down. Uneven, water-damaged floors and basements with sagging ceilings meander and curl, hemmed in by books. Too many books. Books piled in ponderous towers. Rows of ancient books filled with horrors lost to histories never lived. It is a narrow store but deep. It disappears into endless, curving stacks the farther in you go.CorruptionTo those without , it is only one of a thousand old, run-down bookshops in the city. But it only appears mundane. To those of sufficient Corruption, it is a conduit to places in the Night World and beyond.
\subsection{Corruption 2}
CorruptionThose with  2 find nothing unusual about the layout, only that it is cramped, narrow, deep, and ill-kept. They can interact with the proprietor and thumb through books on the shelves. If the Handler feels generous, an Agent might find an unusual book or two. One oddity is always available: The King  in any of its many forms. It may be the in Yellow, Red Book, Le Roi en jaune,Libro Secretorum Man or other, more unique forms left to the Hanifesta,dler to devise.\newpage

\subsubsection{OPINT}

\subsubsection{Locating the Bookshop}
Clues to the location of the Bookshop might be found in “The Night Floors” and even in “A Volume of Secret Faces.” Any resident of the Night World might know precisely how to find it. It is possible the Agents won't arrive at the Bookshop until they are released from the Night World in “Like a Map Made of Skin.”In “The Night Floors,” only Thomas Wright, Abigail Wright's father, has been to the Bookshop. He might be a lead in finding it. But the Bookshop is elusive. It comes and goes. The right combination of mental state, time, and circumstance is required to locate it. It can exist nearly anywhere, in any city. Where and when it appears remains up to the Handler.Those who choose to search for it and have an  skill of 40\% or higher or have  1+ lose 0/1  from the unnatural after a prolonged search. If SANthe  roll fails, they return to a storefront they could SANswear was abandoned minutes before. The Bookshop waits for them inside.
\subsection{Corruption 3}
CorruptionAt  3, oddities are noticeable in the Bookshop. Other customers might be heard wandering deeper in the stacks, though the proprietor claims they are alone. Agents searching for strangeness find books not quite from Earth. When alone, they might even catch glimpses in the maze-like stacks of people known to them, dead, missing, or otherwise. This SANcosts 0/1  from the unnatural. Catching up with such people is impossible. Pursuit down the narrow stacks ends with the phantoms vanishing around a corner, or the pursuer knocking over a pile of books and falling down. When they recover, the person they were pursuing is gone.// Exeunt: The Bookshop //
\subsection{Corruption 4+}
At Corruption 4+, nearly any customer from the future or past might be met in the stacks of the Bookshop, regardless of the year. Agents stating their intent to find someone there gain +1 Corruption and might run into any of the following: »A small Caucasian man with black hair, terrible yellowed teeth, and a pock-marked complexion, Chastaigne wears a doublet and hose, with a fur-lined coat and collar and a yellow hood and cloak. He looks positively medieval, sick, and ill-fed. His face is filled with otherworldly wonder. In one hand, he holds a 20th-century French novel from the series Les   Chastaigne Rois maudits,“The Accursed Kings.”jabbers in Old French; all comprehension rolls Foreign Language (French)with  are at -20\%. He babbles about a “door in the study” which led him here, and the “book of the 72 divine shapes.” If asked what he means, he explains that a man named Bael, who is perhaps a demon sent by the Devil, explained them to him. He exchanges names with the Agents, but then a deep and resonant gong sounds from somewhere out of sight, and he suddenly runs off into the book stacks. He cannot be found again.\newpage
// Exeunt: The Bookshop // » A small, furtive, dark-haired, spectacled Caucasian man in his thirties, dressed in a pristine, exotic, lavender suit. An Agent with Art (Fashion)History at 10\% or higher,  at 30\% or INT×5higher, or who succeeds at an  roll places the suit style as from the 1920s. He speaks with the Agents on matters dealing with art, architecture, or design. If an Agent succeeds at a skill roll relevant to those subjects, Daribon di offers the opinion that buildings might be made to approach the divine, and in so doing, be imbued with divine properties. Divinity is ascribed through perception, which means all of us have the ability to create gods. Otherwise, he rebuffs any approach with a “Good day,” and leaves, mumbling about “fools.” » A tall, gaunt African-American man in his sixties, dressed in a long coat and heavy clothing. He speaks in monosyllables unless  is brought up. Then his wordThe King in Yellowiness increases, but only to interrogate the Agents on what they know about the play. If he feels they know too much about “his work,” he swears at them, threatens to “kill Wilde for what he told you!” and disappears into the stacks. Those that pursue find the small red door leading to Barbas's  house (see on page 131) shutting just as they arrive, as if Barbas somehow exited through the bars in front of the tiny portal. If he has been met before by the Agents, he vehemently denies it, and refuses to speak. »A squat, sweaty, balding Caucasian man in his forties, wearing a double-breasted wool jacket, a porkpie hat, and two-tone shoes. Moseby is surprisingly intelligent, and is open to the discussion of any subject involving literature or the occult. He has extensive knowledge of forbidden texts like the . If NecronomiconThe King  is brought up, Moseby happily claims in Yellowto be the author of the play. If engaged in conversation, Moseby reveals he has been working too hard and is off for a vacation to “the continent.” He does not say precisely where.124// Impossible Landscapes //
\subsection{Robert R. Robert, Proprietor}
Mr. Robert is anything but enigmatic. He introduces himself at once, always as “B.R. Robert,” inserting himself seamlessly into conversations in the practiced way of a diplomat or a spy. He says to call him Bob. He smiles and laughs and catches people entirely offguard. His business card is thick, hand-pressed vellum which reads “B. R. Robert, bibliopola.” It gives no phone number or address phone number or address.Robert is an older North African gentleman with a rough face, a gap between his teeth, and small, silver-framed, folding glasses. He speaks with a slight French-African accent, but his diction is as clipped and precise as his clothing. He wears tweed coats with Arabic labels, silk socks made in Gibraltar, and velvet waistcoats from Sevastopol. As meticulous as he is in his appearance, he is equally dismissive of the Bookshop itself. His voice is full of disdain when he discusses it. “An inconstant font of knowledge, it is so. But my lot in life is to fill all wanting vessels.”Minutes of conversation with him spin into hours. He always has something important, enlightening, or startling to say. Even though it seems he is always talking, somehow he manages to draw secrets and truth from those with whom he converses. They seem to surprise even themselves.On books and writing, he is an endless source of knowledge. If it is a book, he has read it, often in multiple languages. He lets fall brief summaries of his unworthy thoughts on nearly any written subject. In the Bookshop, he encourages customers to “wander far and wide, and search for what is hidden!”He informs Agents that the WC is hidden to the right of the front desk, deadpanning the joke. That's where he keeps his ledgers in a strongbox. (See  on page 128 for details.)Robert is a Repeater, a soul caught in the tidal pull of the Night World forever, and can never escape. Nor does he wish to.As far as Robert can recall, the Bookshop has always been. It serves many locales. Sometimes, it is in Paris in the 1890s. Sometimes, it is in New York: 1921 and 1925 and 1929 and 1995. Sometimes, it is in a \newpage

Most can be Aused anywhere in the Night World with only the slightest changes.The PatzuThe gents hear a whispered conversation beyond Ahigh bookshelves. They cannot make out the first words, but they clearly hear a man say, “The patzu, this is the way out.” Digging through the books reveals a gap to the other side of the shelves.

Something big shifts on top of the bookshelves next to the gents. Those peering into the dark see Aa man lying as if asleep on the top shelf. He has the look of a classic, Depression-era hobo. He smiles with yellowed teeth and makes a “Shhh” gesture.125\newpage

He has a photographic memory and consumes books like food. At night, he lives in those stories in his dreams.

Books and magazines have been torn, scratched up, and piled in a large nest.Piles of refuse lie scattered around the area: long-dried scraps of water-ruined books, shards of Survival broken glass, and finishing nails.

An gent who makes a  roll at a A-20\% penalty can keep track well enough to return to the front of the store.Finally, the proprietor pulls up a trapdoor set in the wood floor, climbs down a few steps, and pulls a string to turn on a lightbulb. The entrance and the \newpage

In the darkness they can make out no details. SANThis costs 0/1  from the unnatural. The proprietor trots up the steps, slams the trapdoor shut, and hands the book to the gents.AShotguns, MasksThe Agents come upon an odd clearing in the maze of bookcases. This small area has a round bench in the middle, surrounded by sinuous, book-laden shelves. Next to the bench are a crowbar, a scattering of shaved wood packing material, and the top of a small wooden crate.Shoved beneath the bench is a shallow wooden crate, recently opened. Inside the shaved-wood packing are a long, leather trench coat; an old, oversize, full-face gas mask; and a recently-oiled pump shotgun that looks new (though it is stamped 1954), fully loaded.

The sounds here are quite loud. It is clear some sort of play is going on next door. ny Awho have read might recognize The King in Yellow snippets from it. Others hear snippets now, perhaps some of those from the chapter introductions. But before the play can continue, there are screams and shouts that are obviously real, and the rumbling booms of people running up on stage. The sounds 127\newpage
// Exeunt: The Bookshop //DISINFORMATIONABOUT ABIGAIL WRIGHTIf the Agents ask B.R. Robert about Abigail Wright, he is forthcoming and eager to help. He digs through ledgers (a does so reveals the most recent is stamped 1949), and folds one open. The listings are written in Arabic so perfect that they look machine printed. Every time a customer purchases something, Robert files another entry in Arabic along with the date.He recalls Wright and her disappearance “from the news.” He tracks his finger down the line and locates an entry that places Abigail Wright at the Bookshop on 22 FEB 1995. It doesn't list the book purchased.Agents who have Foreign Language (Arabic)make a successful roll, can attempt a while Robert pages through it. Failure indicates they catch a glimpse at a single line in Arabic:“And stood awhile in thought.”Success indicates they see the following four lines:“He took his vorpal sword in hand:Long time the manxome foe he sought——So rested he by the Tumtum tree,And stood awhile in thought.”The words sound familiar to almost all Agents, but unless the players know it their origin remains just out of reach.When Robert leaves the desk, he locks the ledgers in an ancient, key-operated strongbox next to the desk along with the money box, as if the ledgers contain valuable information. No matter how distracted he is, he always locks them up before leaving.128128// Impossible Landscapes //Search roll when he  at 20\% or higher, or who Search roll to read the ledger (CONTINUED)\newpage
// Impossible Landscapes //ABOUT ABIGAIL WRIGHT (CONT'D)Agents who somehow gain access to the ledgers find that the Arabic in them repeats every 28 lines, each next to a date on the accompanying line. Those that read Arabic soon discover why. The entries are nothing but the poem “Jabberwocky” by Lewis Carroll from Alice in Wonderland translated into Arabic, repeating over and over for a thousand pages or more. There is no information on clients or transactions. The entries are dated in French and begin at “30 Août 1895” (August 30, 1895). The handwriting is identical throughout all the books. The earliest entries are in brown ink, faded with age. Ten pages in, a single entry is marked “30 Août 1895, Londres aujourd'hui(“August 30, 1895, London today”). All this strangeness costs 0/1 from the unnatural.If confronted with this information, Robert laughs it off. He is eidetic and recalls every customer.

\section{Characters}
The only permanent character in the Bookshop is its proprietor. All others are merely passing through.
\subsection{Robert Robert Robert}
Robert is a finely dressed gentleman of imposing height and build. The longer he is interacted with, the more imperfections the Agents spot. Nicotine stains on his fingers and lips. Cracked lips. Sores on his fingers and on the corners of his mouth. Jaundice-yellowed eyes. His teeth, Sears dentures stamped with the year 1901, always remain pearlescent white.Robert remembers little of his history and is glad of it. He's fairly certain he was party to awful things before the Bookshop opened its doors.130// Impossible Landscapes //Robert Robert RobertBibliopola, age apparently 5514 12 11 15 10 16STR CON DEX INT POW CHA 13 10 0HP WP SAN  To sell copies of The MOTIVATIONS AND DISORDERS:King in Yellow.To spread rumors for Mister Wilde.To wait for his “revelation.”Alertness 40\%, Anthropology 30\%, Art (History) SKILLS:30\%, Bureaucracy 30\%, Craft (Mechanics) 20\%, Dodge 30\%, Drive 30\%, Firearms 40\%, Foreign Language (Arabic) 65\%, Foreign Language (Berber) 45\%, Foreign Language (English) 70\%, Foreign Language (French) 50\%, Foreign Language (Spanish) 20\%, Foreign Language (Tartessian) 15\%, History 70\%, HUMINT 70\%, Persuade 80\%, Ride 30\%, Stealth 30\%.Browning FN Model 1903 pistol 40\%, ATTACKS:damage 1D10.Unarmed 40\%, damage 1D4.\newpage
